Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Stanislav, a father of three amazing kids and a loving husband. I have a strong passion for creating and building things with my own hands, whether it's a DIY project around the house or a creative endeavor in my workshop. Nature holds a special place in my heart, and I find solace and inspiration in its beauty and serenity.

Professionally, I am a software developer with a focus on C++ and Python. I am constantly striving to enhance my skills and explore new avenues in the fascinating world of programming. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the field of robotics, where I love combining my programming knowledge with my love for building and creating.

Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and learnings as I navigate the realms of software development, DIY projects, and my adventures in robotics. Thank you for visiting!

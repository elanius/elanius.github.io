This Git graph serves as a visual representation of my educational journey, career progression, and significant side
projects. Each commit symbolizes roles I've held and achievements within various companies, as well as other career
milestones. You can also find my concise resume in PDF format [here](/assets/resume-alexovic.pdf).

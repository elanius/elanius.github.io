  At <a href="https://www.photoneo.com/" target="_blank">Photoneo</a>, a company specializing in the development
  of advanced 3D vision systems for industrial applications and robotics, I embarked on a career in the field of
  robotics. This decision has proven to be highly rewarding, as it allowed me to seamlessly integrate my passion
  for programming with practical, real-world applications.
</p>
<p>
  My primary responsibility involved the development of software for autonomous mobile robots using ROS.
  This encompassed tasks such as establishing communication with various sensors, including LiDAR, cameras,
  and IMU, as well as controlling actuators like motors through PLC. Additionally, I was responsible for
  maintaining a Docker image used for deploying the software onto the robot. I also contributed to the development
  of robot simulation using Gazebo. Furthermore, I designed and implemented an API that utilized RabbitMQ for
  accessing the robot from higher-level logic systems.
</p>
<p>
  Subsequently, I utilized the robot API to develop fleet management software as a standalone Python application.
  This fleet software was employed in conjunction with warehouse management software to coordinate multiple
  robots within the warehouse.
</p>
<p>
  As part of the fleet development, I also created a fleet simulation environment, used for testing the fleet
  management software. The simulation utilized the Gazebo server, enabling communication with the robots' backend
  through Gazebo protobuf messages. This entire setup was encapsulated within Docker containers for seamless
  deployment on a single computer.

  In my last year of university, I worked for a small local <a href="https://www.alternet.sk/" target="_blank">company</a>
  whose aim was to provide internet mainly over Wi-Fi to suburban areas.
  In addition to this, the company also developed its own firmware for Wi-Fi routers,
  and I was responsible for developing and maintaining this firmware.

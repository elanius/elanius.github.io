  I had the opportunity to become a doctoral student while working at <a href="https://www.photoneo.com/" target="_blank">Photoneo</a>
  within the <a href="https://tuke.sk/wps/portal/tuke/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8zifRxNTYy8TAx8_S3MjAwcAzxD_FxMfAP8TA30w_Wj9KOASgxwAEcD_eDibP2C7LxyAPcLiYQ!/dz/d5/L0lHSkovd0RNQUZrQUVnQSEhLzROVkUvZW4!/" target="_blank">Technical University of Ko≈°ice</a>,
  <a href="https://fei.tuke.sk/en"target="_blank">Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics</a>,
  in the Department of <a href="http://kem.fei.tuke.sk/en/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering and Mechatronics</a>.
  This opportunity arose because our remote office was located directly on the university campus.

<p>
  During my studies, I focused on research in the field of mobile robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles.
  For my <a href="/assets/disertation-thesis-alexovic.pdf" target="_blank">dissertation thesis</a>,
  I developed a drone capable of mapping and navigating in GPS-denied environments.

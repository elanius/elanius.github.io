  During my university studies, I worked for a startup company with the goal of creating a copyright
  security application. My main task was to develop an application that could bind the existing software
  to specific hardware, thereby preventing its use on any other computer.

  This role involved a significant amount of reverse engineering and low-level programming.
  The security application performed code injection into PE format files (.exe, .dll) by injecting routines
  that checked hardware signatures. If the 'patched' application was run on a different computer,
  it would crash. It could only run on the computer for which it was purchased.

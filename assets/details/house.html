  Building my own house marked a significant milestone in my personal growth. It provided me with invaluable
  hands-on experience, encompassing various manual skills such as constructing concrete structures, bricklaying,
  assembling wooden constructions, plastering, insulation, painting, wiring, and more.

  Beyond acquiring these practical skills, I also gained essential interpersonal and project management skills.
  I learned how to collaborate effectively with others, how to plan and execute a project, and how to navigate
  and solve unforeseen challenges. Perhaps the most profound lesson was the importance of flexibility and
  adaptability; I discovered that strict adherence to a plan is often impractical, and one must be open to
  adjusting and improvising in response to changing circumstances.

# About
This repository contains my personal web page hosted on GitHub, which can be found at https://elanius.github.io/. It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static web page generator, and I am using the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) theme.

I made slight changes to the source code to enable custom JavaScript on subpages. I am utilizing [gitgraph.js](https://www.nicoespeon.com/gitgraph.js/) with my own modifications for drawing the Git graph to represent my CV and also [fslightbox.js](https://fslightbox.com/) for a gallery of pictures.

Outside, it was still relatively cold. Night temperatures remained below zero, but daytime temperatures had risen above freezing, causing the thick blanket of snow to slowly melt. I had a feeling that the temperature would continue to rise in the coming days, even though it was December. It was a Sunday, and I felt the need to go outside, alone, to the woods. I wanted to clear my mind and enjoy the winter landscape while there was still snow, and not just mud.

I was slowly walking on hil slope looking around and enjoying frees air. Nature was silent as it is usual in winter. I was thinking if there will be some
animals which I could see.
